# Ride sharing app

Please notice that is the alpha version. It's uncompleted and I will be updating it in future

## Installation

To run you need to download the repo and do

back-end:
```bash
cd /backend
php artisan serve
php artisan websockets:serve
```
front-end:

npm run dev
```
## IMPORTANT NOTICE

Again as I said, it's on developing right now, so it's working on bare minimum
